## Windows Event IDs to log.

*4688: A new process was executed
*4624: Successful Authentication
*5140: A network share was accessed
*5156: Windows firewall network connection
*7045: A new service was added to an endpoint
*4663: File and registry auditing
*4648: Logon using "explicit credentials". When accessing remote systems in a Windows environment, there is typically no explicit credentials being used (due to Windows access tokens and SSO). Whenever authentication is performed using "explicit credentials" (ex. explicitly providing a password), this event ID will trigger.
*4728, 4732, 4756: A user was added to a privileged group and can be useful in later stages of the APT attack cycle, should adversaries be creating additional admin accounts (4728 - User added to Domain Admins group).


Detect lateral movement event IDs:
*4688
*4689: A process has exited

Example 1 -- Attacker compromises initial system and performs initial recon - 4688

Example 2 -- Detect pass-the-hash (PtC) utilizing Ketshash tool - 4648, 4672 4624, 4776, 4768, 4769

Example 3 -- Detect "fake" accounts being used - 4648, 4672, 4624, 4776, 4768, 4769

Example 4 -- Monitor a member (user) being added to a security-enabled group and filter for "Domain Admins" group.

Example 5 -- For Golden Ticket attacks and anomalies in tickets being used - 4624, 4672, 4678



Note -- Enable command line logging and Advanced Audit Policy in Windows!!
